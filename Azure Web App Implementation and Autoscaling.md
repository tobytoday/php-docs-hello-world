### Project Title: **Azure Web App Implementation and Autoscaling**

#### Project Overview:
This project demonstrates my ability to create, configure, and scale a web application using Azure App Services, a Platform as a Service (PaaS) offering from Microsoft Azure. As part of the Azure Administrator training (AZ-104), I implemented key features, such as deploying a web app from GitHub, creating a deployment slot, and configuring autoscaling to optimize performance during high-demand scenarios.

#### Key Objectives:
1. **Web App Deployment**: Deploy a PHP-based "Hello World" application from an external GitHub repository onto an Azure Web App.
2. **Staging and Production Slots**: Configure deployment slots to safely swap between production and staging environments.
3. **Continuous Deployment**: Enable continuous deployment for the web app, ensuring the latest version of the app is always deployed.
4. **Autoscaling**: Implement autoscaling to automatically adjust resources during high-traffic periods.

### Tasks Breakdown:

#### 1. **Create and Configure an Azure Web App**
- Deployed a web app using the Azure portal and specified a PHP 8.2 runtime stack on a Linux OS.
- Used an Azure resource group to manage related resources, ensuring an organized and cost-efficient environment.
  
**Technologies:**
- Azure Web App Service
- PHP 8.2
- Azure Resource Groups

#### 2. **Create and Configure a Deployment Slot**
- Created a "staging" deployment slot to test code before deploying it to production.
- Implemented a continuous integration and deployment pipeline using GitHub as the external source for the web app's code.

**Technologies:**
- Azure Deployment Slots
- GitHub Integration for Continuous Deployment

#### 3. **Swap Deployment Slots**
- Safely swapped the staging slot with the production slot, ensuring tested code was released to production.
- Verified that the "Hello World!" application was successfully deployed to both staging and production environments.

**Technologies:**
- Azure Deployment Slots for Production and Staging

#### 4. **Configure and Test Autoscaling**
- Configured automatic scaling to handle increased traffic and resource demands. Set a maximum burst value to allow up to 2 additional instances during peak loads.
- Performed a load test using Azure Load Testing features, monitoring response times and virtual users.

**Technologies:**
- Azure Autoscale
- Azure Load Testing

### Features and Highlights:
- **GitHub Integration**: Configured continuous deployment using an external GitHub repository for seamless updates.
- **Deployment Slots**: Enabled smooth transitions between staging and production environments to reduce downtime during updates.
- **Autoscaling**: Automatically scaled app resources to maintain performance during high traffic, helping to minimize costs during periods of low traffic.

### Project Outcomes:
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with Azure App Services, deployment slots, and autoscaling. This demonstrates my ability to manage cloud-based web applications effectively, including setting up continuous deployment pipelines, ensuring seamless transitions between environments, and maintaining optimal performance through autoscaling.
